## How to use
* AppleXchange is a simple web app that lets you sell and buy iPhones and MacBooks.

* The home page lists all of the Apple products that the web app allows for trade. If you don't own one of these products, you can't sell it. Sorry! You can however still buy from other people.
* You can click on one of the products on the front page to take a look at the product information, as well as all the listings other people have put up for sale of that product.
* Click on one of these listings to view the listing information which includes the product's specs, condition, seller, and the listing price.
* From here you have the option to buy the listing if you're interested and have enough money. If you choose to do so, both you and the seller's account balances will be updated based on the transaction, and both will now have a record of the exchange.
* If you would like to create a listing, simply click on 'Create a Listing' located on the navigation bar, which will give you a choice between listing an iPhone or Macbook. This will take you to a form to fill out to put your device up for sale.
